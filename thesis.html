This is how it all starts.
<br>
<br>Let’s begin by setting the context.
<br>You are a conscious being, surrounded by analog beings, or objects. Although this can be argued, all is very tangible. These things are part of what you consider the real world, or the world filtered through your fives senses.
<br>This is the meatspace. 
<br>Yet, the screen you are facing and through which you are reading those lines does not only exist as a physical object, it happens to also be a window that allows an entry into another kind of space. This space does not have any kind of form or physical substance and does not obey to any Cartesian law, yet it incorporates a terminology of spatiality that mimics that of the material world and is indeed perceived and experienced as three-dimensional<a class="hyperfoot" href="#footnote1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref1" style="text-decoration:none"></a>. 
<br>This is the cyberspace.
<br>The windows from which that other ‘placeless place’ is entered may be described as similar on certain degrees to Foucault’s examination of mirrors<a class="hyperfoot" href="#footnote2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref2" style="text-decoration:none"></a>. Mirrors are palpable visual devices that hold within them a virtual space, as they involve a complex play of gaze and place the viewer in a suspended state of being simultaneously visible and concealed, here and there, included and excluded.
<br>Reciprocally, the cyberspace may appear as some kind of equally disruptive space, a heterotopia in the Foucaultian sense, where a utopia would have effectively taken place and in which ‘an alternative social ordering is performed’<a class="hyperfoot" href="#footnote3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref3" style="text-decoration:none"></a>. It offers a computer generated reality in which human fantasies ought to bloom while still echoing the real world and modifying its dynamics. In that sense, cyberspace is not an isolated, exceptional entity but is indeed completely inscribed in the material landscape, it is as much altered by reality than it alters the latter itself.  
<br>The term cyberspace first appeared in 1968 as the moniker of the collaboration between artists Sussane Hussing and Carsten Hoff who developed an interest in cybernetics<a class="hyperfoot" href="#footnote4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref4" style="text-decoration:none"></a> and imagined <span class="ateliercyberspace">organic sensory environments and experimental architectural structures</span> to interrogate technology as an enriching factor to human life and built environment without however really getting into the digital realm. The term then became popular in the 1990s after William Gibson used it in a series of three science-fiction short novels written between 1984 and 1988 to describe the digital dystopian arena in which a ’consensual hallucination is experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation’<a class="hyperfoot" href="#footnote5" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="footnotes-ref5" style="text-decoration:none"></a>.
