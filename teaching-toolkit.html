Typography and editorial design

<br><br>
<br>Toolkit ;--)))) is an exercice in typography, editorial design, research, documentation, imagination, self-expression, communication, teaching, learning and gathering. Participants choose a thematic over the three dozens proposed (relating to social issues, politics, science, pseudo-science, health, ecology, spirituality, food, work, the arts, etc) or make up one of their own. By the end of the seven-days workshop, each participant is expected to have written and designed their own toolkit, made as many copies of it as there are participants and bound one big publication compiling the copies they received in return. The workshop culminates in a gathering where each participant introduces their toolkit and reads, or performs, parts of it. The collection then serves as a companion of sorts.
